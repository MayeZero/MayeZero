## Projects
### [AR-Based Robot Teleoperation System | Designer & Developer ](https://github.com/MayeZero/ARFranka3)
-  User Experience Design Project (INFO90009), The University of Melbourne, Feb 2025 ‚Äì Jun 2025
-  We have designed and implemented an AR-based teleoperation system for manipulator robots through
mobile phones. Instead of following instruction manuals and coding to control the robot in a desktop
platform, our system offers a more intuitive and interactive approach for users to operate the robot.
- Skills: Unity, Figma, C#
- Achievements: The system seamlessly integrates AR, digital twins, user interface interactions, forward and
inverse kinematics control of the robot, along with trajectory recording, viewing, editing, and simulation
capabilities. It also provides multimodal feedback for a more intuitive user experience.
- üèÜ **Computing and Information Systems Discipline Award from Endeavour Exhibition 2025**

### [Distributed Shared White Board | Designer & Developer ](https://github.com/MayeZero/WeDraw)
-  Distributed Systems (COMP90015), The University of Melbourne, Feb 2025 ‚Äì Jun 2025
-  I have designed and implemented a distributed system for a shared whiteboard that allows multiple users
to draw simultaneously on the same canvas.
-  Skills: Java/Java RMI
-  Achievements: It presents a fully functional and interactive distributed whiteboard system that supports
real-time collaboration, drawing, chatting, and user/file management. By leveraging Java RMI and a
multi-threaded architecture, the system ensures responsive communication and a smooth user experience.

### [Arcade 3D Pinball | Designer & Developer](https://github.com/WayneBrysen/MobileComputingPinballGame)
- Mobile Computing Systems Programming (COMP90018), The University of Melbourne, Jul 2024 ‚Äì Nov 2024
- We have designed and implemented a sensor-based mobile game that allows players to compete in
real-time multiplayer mode, battling simultaneously for the highest score.
- Skills: Unity, C#
- Achievements: The game features touch pressure detection for flipper control and supports real-time
multiplayer battles using Photon. It also includes time-based challenges, scoring systems, and
microphone-controlled launching, all of which enhance the interactivity and overall player experience.
